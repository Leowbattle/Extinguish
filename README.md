# Extinguish
Minecraft Forge mod.

https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/extinguish

Have you ever been playing Minecraft and come across a massive out of control fire? Did it kill your FPS? Did it kill your trees? Did it kill your motivation to rebuild your wooden house?

 

Well, I know just the thing for you!

 

Type /extinguish to extinguish all fire within 200 blocks of you.

 

Extinguish will automatically deal with fire from other mods too because it checks the unlocalised name to see if it contains the string "fire".

Remember that it is also a good idea to keep backups of your world (like with ([Aroma Backup](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/aromabackup)), just in case you can't put your fire out with /extinguish.

In the config you can change the permission level of the command, so server owners can decide who gets to use it.
